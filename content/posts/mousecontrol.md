So, at `RU Hacking?` I won both a `Google Home Mini` and a `Rival 110` gaming
mouse. The mouse lets you set the color, which is kinda cool.

Now, I'm a hacker so I though I should combine these things. And I did.

Result is here: https://github.com/bahorn/voice-controlled-mouse

It's exactly as useless as you'd think.
