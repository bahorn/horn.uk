We've had some recent interest at CovHackSoc in Sign language, so I wrote a
scrapper for the BSL signbank [1] to translate text into videos of the sentence.

Code is here [2]

<script type="text/javascript" src="/js/speed-project.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">if (FATLab_SpeedProject) {FATLab_SpeedProject.Values.Format='normal'; FATLab_SpeedProject.Values.TimeSpent=240; FATLab_SpeedProject.Make();}</script>

(was actually less than 2 hours. Would have been under an hour but we were trying to
use the pomodoro method this library sesh.)
